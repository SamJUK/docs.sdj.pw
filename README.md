# DOCS.SDJ.PW

The goal of this platform is provide an centralised knowledge base, primarily for my self and colleagues. Although I am sure, some of this will be useful to the wider community.

- Hosted over at [https://docs.sdj.pw](https://docs.sdj.pw/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=sdj_pw)
- Built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/)


## Configuring as a Custom Search Engine
Custom Search Engines are where you enter a set keyphrase into the omnibar followed by a tab, and it will search directly that site. For example, I configure `sdj` as the phrase, so if i enter `sdj<tab>varnish`. It will navigate me directly to the search page of this site displaying varnish content.
