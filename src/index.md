# SDJ Docs

The goal of this platform is provide an centralised knowledge base, primarily for my self and colleagues. Although I am sure, some of this will be useful to the wider community.

Everything is open-source, and public contributions are encouraged. Read more over on the [Github Repository](https://www.github.com/samjuk/docs.sdj.pw).

> **NOTE:** Whilst we are still figuring out the best categorisation for content, some URLs may change. We will do our best to ensure accurate 301s are in place.

## Custom Search Engine

If you find yourself referring to this site a fair bit. I would suggest configuring it as a custom search engine in your browser. Which allows you to search this site directly from the omnibar. Similar to over on my Blog at [sdj.pw](https://www.sdj.pw/)

::: info
@TODO - Customise the Search to be CSE compatible, then update this section.
